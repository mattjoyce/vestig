It assesses confidence, interest in skill development, preferred support, and perceived barriers, while also exploring interest in training and future initiatives. The survey provides multiple-choice questions covering usage frequency, activities, subscription status, and desired AI integration areas. Respondents can contact a dedicated email for any questions.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- Respondents select the service area they primarily support, such as Private Hospitals, Home Care, Residential Aged Care, and others.\n- The survey captures respondents' role at Calvary, offering options like Executive Leader, Senior Management, and Operational Management.\n- Frequency of AI/LLM tool usage in the past two weeks is measured, ranging from regular daily/weekly use to never or policy\u2011uncertain use.\n- A wide set of AI\u2011related activities is listed, including automating admin tasks, supporting clinical decisions, creating reports, and brainstorming.\n- Respondents indicate whether they pay for AI tool subscriptions, with options for free use, premium subscriptions, or no use.\n- Confidence in using AI/LLM tools is rated on a 5\u2011point Likert scale from Very confident to No confidence.\n- Interest in developing AI/LLM skills for work is captured using a 5\u2011point Likert scale from Very interested to Not interested at all.\n- Attending a half\u2011day internal training workshop on AI/LLM tools is explored with options from definitely interested to not interested.\n- Key barriers to greater AI tool usage are identified, including technology access, time constraints, policy uncertainty, accuracy concerns, and data privacy worries.\n- Respondents indicate the most valuable AI support types (technical support, use\u2011case examples, training, coaching, policies) and are provided a contact email for queries.\n- Potential benefit areas for AI integration are listed, such as clinical documentation, quality monitoring, patient communication, and administrative efficiency.\n- Interest in participating in new AI initiatives is captured with Yes, No, and Maybe response options.\n\n**Themes:** AIUsage, Barriers, Training, Support, Roles, Benefits\n\n---\n\n(score=0.6975, age=1d, stability=static)\nThe survey asks how often respondents have used AI/LLM tools in the last two weeks, offering choices: regularly (daily/weekly), occasionally (monthly or less), rarely (once or twice), never, and not allowed/unsure of policy.\n\n---\n\n(score=0.6794, age=1d, stability=static)\nThe survey asks what type of AI or technology support would be most valuable for respondents' roles, with options such as technical support, use\u2011case examples, advanced training, introductory literacy training, one\u2011on\u2011one coaching, hands\u2011on workshops, peer learning groups, clear policies, and Other.\n\n---\n\n(score=0.6760, age=1d, stability=static)\nThe survey lists multiple activities for which AI tools may be used, including automating routine administrative tasks, supporting clinical decisions, developing policies, creating reports, preparing for meetings, analysing data, creating training materials, brainstorming, researching, writing emails, and Other.\n",
