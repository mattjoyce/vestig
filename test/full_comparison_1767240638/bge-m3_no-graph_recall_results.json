CIO John Sutherland and CEO Damien Bruce evaluated a coding optimisation proposal from Beamtree and opted for a small, confidential trial to test the PICQ audit in private hospitals, aligning with Calvary's risk\u2011management goals and upstream quality strategy.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- The BeamTree PICQ project brief was created on December 10, 2025, is in Executive Review \u2013 Pre\u2011engagement Assessment, and is marked high sensitivity.\n- John Sutherland (CIO) and Damien Bruce (CEO) met with Beamtree, who presented a coding optimisation/audit proposal including a PICQ audit, trial letter, data extract specification, and slides.\n- No commitments were made; the proposal is considered sensitive for coders/HIMs and any rollout would likely be a top\u2011down directive.\n- A prior Beamtree engagement with Calvary did not progress due to technical/data constraints and differing opinions on approach.\n- Calvary views Beamtree as an upstream quality signal that complements Phoebe\u2019s downstream claim\u2011checking, creating a continuum of quality assurance.\n- John tasked the team to confidentially review Beamtree materials, form an assessment, and schedule a \u201ccompare notes\u201d follow\u2011up; no formal deadline was set.\n- The preferred recommendation (Option B) is a small, controlled trial using 1\u20112 months of recent data from 1\u20112 private hospitals on a single service line, with minimal integration changes and strict confidentiality.\n- The trial aims to reduce clawbacks and improve defensibility as part of risk management, aligning with Calvary\u2019s mission of fair resourcing for patient care.\n- Implementation will be co\u2011designed with HIM and coders to support professional practice rather than surveillance.\n- John and Damien made an informed decision regarding the Beamtree trial.\n- The document summarizing the Beamtree trial was created and last updated on December 10, 2025.\n\n**Themes:** sensitivity, trial, upstream, downstream, risk management, confidentiality, co\u2011design\n\n---\n\n(score=0.5192, age=1d, stability=static)\nThe vendor for the proposal is Beamtree.\n",

Over 185 respondents provided insights across six structured sections, informing planned workshops, investment priorities, and an emerging AI strategy. An executive briefing presented initial findings to senior leadership, and data collection is now complete, awaiting comparative analysis.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- The survey was launched on 2025-08-05 targeting approximately 250 Calvary leaders, designed to take under 5 minutes, offered anonymous participation, and included a commitment to share results and actions.\n- It was organized into six sections covering background, current AI/LLM usage, skills & interest, barriers & support needs, future vision, and contact information.\n- The intended outcomes included developing practical workshops, informing technology investment priorities, identifying implementation champions, and shaping an AI strategy aligned with the organization\u2019s mission and values.\n- An executive briefing on 2025-08-29 presented the initial analysis of 113 leadership responses to CIO John Sutherland, outlining key insights and organizational implications.\n- The survey was extended on 2025-09-26 to the Digital Health Technology team (~130 staff) using the same six\u2011section design for consistency and comparative analysis.\n- Response rates were 45% for leadership (113 of ~250) and 55% for DHT (72 of ~130), yielding a combined total of 185 completed surveys.\n- Data collection for both surveys is complete, enabling comparative analysis between leadership and technical teams, though analysis and response development are still pending.\n\n**Themes:** survey, AI adoption, leadership, digital health, response rate, analysis, workshops\n\n---\n\n(score=0.6615, age=1d, stability=static)\nMatt Joyce is the project lead for the AI Adoption Survey.\n\n---\n\n(score=0.6534, age=1d, stability=static)\nOn 2025-08-05 the AI Adoption Survey was launched with an initial email sent to approximately 250 Calvary leaders; the survey focused on AI/technology usage and needs assessment for senior management, targeted senior managers and leaders across the Calvary organization, was designed to take less than 5 minutes, offered anonymous participation with optional voluntary contact sharing, and included a commitment to respond to participants with results and actions. The comprehensive survey consisted of 6 sections and 36 questions covering background, usage, skills, barriers, vision, and follow\u2011up.\n",
