It details the preferred integration of PICQ outputs into coding worklists, incorporates the downstream claim\u2011checking tool Phoebe, and maps the full workflow from documentation to claim submission. Past initiatives at Calvary faced staff resistance, highlighting the need for careful stakeholder engagement.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- The BeamTree PICQ Assessment Framework was authored on Dec 10, 2025 as an internal template to evaluate the proposal for discussion with John Sutherland.\n- Prior similar initiatives at Calvary encountered a \"Frosty\" reception, indicating notable staff resistance to change.\n- Integration of PICQ outputs is preferred to be directly embedded within coding worklists rather than using a separate portal or spreadsheet.\n- The revenue cycle integration plan includes a downstream claim\u2011checking tool called Phoebe, which validates claims before submission.\n- The end\u2011to\u2011end workflow flows from Clinical Documentation through Coding, then BeamTree PICQ as an upstream quality signal, onward to the coded episode, followed by Phoebe for downstream claim integrity, and finally claim submission.\n- Engagement barriers previously involved key individuals Richard and Martin, suggesting the need to address stakeholder concerns.\n- The document serves as an analysis of integration, establishing the timeline and expectations for the proposed workflow.\n\n**Themes:** Assessment, Integration, Workflow, Resistance, Tooling, Stakeholders\n\n**Open Questions:**\n- What strategies will be employed to mitigate the staff resistance observed in previous Calvary initiatives?\n",
