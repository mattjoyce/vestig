CIO John Sutherland and CEO Damien Bruce evaluated a coding optimisation proposal from Beamtree and opted for a small, confidential trial to test the PICQ audit in private hospitals, aligning with Calvary's risk\u2011management goals and upstream quality strategy.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- The BeamTree PICQ project brief was created on December 10, 2025, is in Executive Review \u2013 Pre\u2011engagement Assessment, and is marked high sensitivity.\n- John Sutherland (CIO) and Damien Bruce (CEO) met with Beamtree, who presented a coding optimisation/audit proposal including a PICQ audit, trial letter, data extract specification, and slides.\n- No commitments were made; the proposal is considered sensitive for coders/HIMs and any rollout would likely be a top\u2011down directive.\n- A prior Beamtree engagement with Calvary did not progress due to technical/data constraints and differing opinions on approach.\n- Calvary views Beamtree as an upstream quality signal that complements Phoebe\u2019s downstream claim\u2011checking, creating a continuum of quality assurance.\n- John tasked the team to confidentially review Beamtree materials, form an assessment, and schedule a \u201ccompare notes\u201d follow\u2011up; no formal deadline was set.\n- The preferred recommendation (Option B) is a small, controlled trial using 1\u20112 months of recent data from 1\u20112 private hospitals on a single service line, with minimal integration changes and strict confidentiality.\n- The trial aims to reduce clawbacks and improve defensibility as part of risk management, aligning with Calvary\u2019s mission of fair resourcing for patient care.\n- Implementation will be co\u2011designed with HIM and coders to support professional practice rather than surveillance.\n- John and Damien made an informed decision regarding the Beamtree trial.\n- The document summarizing the Beamtree trial was created and last updated on December 10, 2025.\n\n**Themes:** sensitivity, trial, upstream, downstream, risk management, confidentiality, co\u2011design\n\n---\n\n[META] (score=0.5384, age=1d, stability=static)\nSemantic match.

Static.\n[MEMORY]\n# BeamTree PICQ Assessment Framework Overview\n\n**Overview:** The BeamTree PICQ Assessment Framework, created on December 10, 2025, outlines a structured approach for evaluating the proposal and guiding internal discussions with John Sutherland. It details the preferred integration of PICQ outputs into coding worklists, incorporates the downstream claim\u2011checking tool Phoebe, and maps the full workflow from documentation to claim submission. Past initiatives at Calvary faced staff resistance, highlighting the need for careful stakeholder engagement.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- The BeamTree PICQ Assessment Framework was authored on Dec 10, 2025 as an internal template to evaluate the proposal for discussion with John Sutherland.\n- Prior similar initiatives at Calvary encountered a \"Frosty\" reception, indicating notable staff resistance to change.\n- Integration of PICQ outputs is preferred to be directly embedded within coding worklists rather than using a separate portal or spreadsheet.\n- The revenue cycle integration plan includes a downstream claim\u2011checking tool called Phoebe, which validates claims before submission.\n- The end\u2011to\u2011end workflow flows from Clinical Documentation through Coding, then BeamTree PICQ as an upstream quality signal, onward to the coded episode, followed by Phoebe for downstream claim integrity, and finally claim submission.\n- Engagement barriers previously involved key individuals Richard and Martin, suggesting the need to address stakeholder concerns.\n- The document serves as an analysis of integration, establishing the timeline and expectations for the proposed workflow.\n\n**Themes:** Assessment, Integration, Workflow, Resistance, Tooling, Stakeholders\n\n**Open Questions:**\n- What strategies will be employed to mitigate the staff resistance observed in previous Calvary initiatives?\n",
