It assesses confidence, interest in skill development, preferred support, and perceived barriers, while also exploring interest in training and future initiatives. The survey provides multiple-choice questions covering usage frequency, activities, subscription status, and desired AI integration areas. Respondents can contact a dedicated email for any questions.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- Respondents select the service area they primarily support, such as Private Hospitals, Home Care, Residential Aged Care, and others.\n- The survey captures respondents' role at Calvary, offering options like Executive Leader, Senior Management, and Operational Management.\n- Frequency of AI/LLM tool usage in the past two weeks is measured, ranging from regular daily/weekly use to never or policy\u2011uncertain use.\n- A wide set of AI\u2011related activities is listed, including automating admin tasks, supporting clinical decisions, creating reports, and brainstorming.\n- Respondents indicate whether they pay for AI tool subscriptions, with options for free use, premium subscriptions, or no use.\n- Confidence in using AI/LLM tools is rated on a 5\u2011point Likert scale from Very confident to No confidence.\n- Interest in developing AI/LLM skills for work is captured using a 5\u2011point Likert scale from Very interested to Not interested at all.\n- Attending a half\u2011day internal training workshop on AI/LLM tools is explored with options from definitely interested to not interested.\n- Key barriers to greater AI tool usage are identified, including technology access, time constraints, policy uncertainty, accuracy concerns, and data privacy worries.\n- Respondents indicate the most valuable AI support types (technical support, use\u2011case examples, training, coaching, policies) and are provided a contact email for queries.\n- Potential benefit areas for AI integration are listed, such as clinical documentation, quality monitoring, patient communication, and administrative efficiency.\n- Interest in participating in new AI initiatives is captured with Yes, No, and Maybe response options.\n\n**Themes:** AIUsage, Barriers, Training, Support, Roles, Benefits\n",
