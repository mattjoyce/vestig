It aims to replace costly and slow external transcription with real\u2011time transcription, reducing turnaround from up to seven days to 24\u201348 hours while improving safety, clinician satisfaction, and patient communication. The pilot is backed by Clinical Governance, cybersecurity and legal reviews, and will be evaluated for broader rollout across the Calvary network.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- Executive sponsorship and Clinical Governance endorsement are secured for the pilot.\n- Current transcription processes cause up to seven\u2011day delays, cost over $116,000 annually, and face staffing risks due to resignations and retirements.\n- The recommended Option 3 is a low\u2011risk, governed pilot involving 29 VMO clinicians at the Hobart Consulting Suites.\n- Pilot timeline includes Preparation (Sep\u2013Nov 2025), Pilot (Dec 2025\u2013Mar 2026), and Evaluation (Mar 2026) with key dates for consent approval, mid\u2011point review, and final evaluation.\n- Funding is provided by Calvary Hobart (site\u2011funded); the overall project has no allocated budget, with a $9,570 subscription for the pilot and a $38,280 continuance cost.\n- Expected benefits include annual savings of $41,817, turnaround reduction to 24\u201348\u202fhours, faster GP communication, improved clinician satisfaction, and a future\u2011proofed admin model.\n- Governance, cybersecurity, and legal reviews are scheduled for October 2025, supported by existing Informatics presence and the Safe Introduction framework.\n- Scope exclusions include direct integration with clinical records, broader rollout to other sites, and exclusive long\u2011term commitment to Heidi Health; consent pathway selection remains uncertain.\n- Evaluation will produce a report covering safety, quality, clinician satisfaction, patient acceptability, cost impacts, and will use human\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop safety metrics.\n\n**Themes:** AI, Pilot, Governance, CostSavings, ClinicalDocumentation, DigitalHealth, RiskManagement, Implementation\n\n**Open Questions:**\n- Which consent pathway (voice, paper, or clinician attestation) will be selected for final approval?\n- What is the planned approach for scaling the AI scribe solution beyond the pilot if it proves successful?\n",

Past initiatives at Calvary faced staff resistance, highlighting the need for careful stakeholder engagement.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- The BeamTree PICQ Assessment Framework was authored on Dec 10, 2025 as an internal template to evaluate the proposal for discussion with John Sutherland.\n- Prior similar initiatives at Calvary encountered a \"Frosty\" reception, indicating notable staff resistance to change.\n- Integration of PICQ outputs is preferred to be directly embedded within coding worklists rather than using a separate portal or spreadsheet.\n- The revenue cycle integration plan includes a downstream claim\u2011checking tool called Phoebe, which validates claims before submission.\n- The end\u2011to\u2011end workflow flows from Clinical Documentation through Coding, then BeamTree PICQ as an upstream quality signal, onward to the coded episode, followed by Phoebe for downstream claim integrity, and finally claim submission.\n- Engagement barriers previously involved key individuals Richard and Martin, suggesting the need to address stakeholder concerns.\n- The document serves as an analysis of integration, establishing the timeline and expectations for the proposed workflow.\n\n**Themes:** Assessment, Integration, Workflow, Resistance, Tooling, Stakeholders\n\n**Open Questions:**\n- What strategies will be employed to mitigate the staff resistance observed in previous Calvary initiatives?\n\n---\n\n(score=0.8553, age=1d, stability=static)\nThe vendor for the proposal is Beamtree.\n\n---\n\n(score=0.8495, age=1d, stability=static)\n# Beamtree PICQ Trial Decision and Next Steps\n\n**Overview:** The BeamTree PICQ project brief was prepared on December 10, 2025 and is under executive review with high sensitivity.
